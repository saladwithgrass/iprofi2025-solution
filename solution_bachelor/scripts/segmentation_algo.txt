1) split all points into segments based on delta_angle
2) split each segment into B bins
3) for each bin, calculate mappings - 2d vectors containing radial distance and height
4) calculate prototype points for each bin in each segment based on the lowest point 
5) fit a line through prototype points in a segment (this line is ground)
6) based on vertical distance from point to that line, select non-ground points
